# Project Title
MySQL Dealership Queries
## Description of the Project

MySQL databases help store and manage data, making it easy for users to search and find the information they need. By running different queries, you can pull data from multiple tables and combine it to show the results in a simple and clear way. This makes it easier to understand and use the information.
